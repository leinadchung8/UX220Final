            <ul>
                <li>PNG images support transparent backgrounds, which JPGs do not, making PNGs ideal for graphics with irregular shapes.</li>
                <li>PNG uses lossless compression, meaning no image data is lost when the file is compressed and decompressed, keeping the quality.</li>
                <li>PNG is better for storing drawings, text, and iconic graphics at a small file size without losing quality.</li>
                <li>PNG supports a higher depth of colors than JPG.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="inferior-heading">Ways that .pngs are inferior to .jpgs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>PNG files are typically larger than JPG files, which can result in more storage use and longer load times on websites.</li>
                <li>JPGs are better for complex images like photographs where reducing file size without a noticeable loss of quality is important.</li>
                <li>JPGs are more universally supported across older software and web services compared to PNGs.</li>
                <li>For web use, smaller file sizes are often necessary JPGs are preferred due to their ability to load faster without quality loss.</li>
