            <p>This form action will not work on GitHub Pages because it leads to a local server (localhost) which is 
            not accessible from the internet. GitHub Pages serves static content and cannot interact with local servers.</p>

            <h2>https://dry-bayou-18746.herokuapp.com/send/</h2>
            <p>The form action has the potential to function on GitHub Pages, providing that the Heroku server is set up to manage post request from Github.
            Since Github pages is capable of interfacing with external servers over HTTPS, it can handle the submissions of forms from other servers. </p>
